                <p><strong>Focus groups shed light on issues affecting membership recruitment</strong></p>
                <p> Old. Male. Inflexible. Elitist. Exclusive. Secretive.</p>
                <p> These are a few of the responses that non-Rotarians consistently   gave in recent Rotary International focus groups when asked what they   think of when they hear the words Rotary International or Rotary club.   The participants were professional women ages 30 and above and men ages   30-45, prescreened by independent market research firms to include   individuals who would satisfy the requirements for Rotary club   membership.</p>
                <p> The purpose of this research was to learn about attitudes regarding   volunteerism and networking among men and women of this age demographic   as well as to gain insight into their awareness and perception of   Rotary. The results show that while general impressions of Rotary are   positive, there is an overwhelming lack of understanding about what   Rotary is and what Rotarians do. Most individuals did not view   themselves as potential Rotarians even though they maintained the   professional requirements for membership.&nbsp; </p>
                <p> Commitment to and interest in giving back to their communities   through volunteerism was a common theme among participants. But what do   you say to someone who says, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to join Rotary to help your   community&rdquo;? Discuss this statement with your club, and come up with a   strategy to showcase Rotary club membership as a flexible, unique, and   valuable way for younger professionals to get involved in their   communities.</p>
                <p> Actively addressing the perception of an old, male, inflexible,   elite, exclusive, and secretive club &mdash; whether any of these words   describe your club or not &mdash; is an important part of educating the public   about Rotary. Think about what this means for your club, and consider   the following:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Open participation in a particular service project to the public.   Post information about the project on local bulletin boards or online   forums, and invite community members to come out and help. The exposure   and word of mouth about what Rotarians do will boost Rotary&rsquo;s public   presence, and you might even interest someone in club membership.</li>
                  <li>Be proactive about making your club and its members more visible   throughout your community. Join your local chamber of commerce. Exhibit   at community fairs or open houses. Display your promotional materials in   new businesses.</li>
                  <li>Make a commitment as a club to increasing your flexibility. Think   again about your response to the statement, &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to join   Rotary to help your community.&rdquo; How can your club demonstrate that you   offer a modern, innovative approach to service?</li>
                  <li>Be creative with your community service projects. Try at least one   new project every year, and make sure it is meeting an important local   need.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
